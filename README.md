# Online FIR System

## Project Description

The Online FIR System is a web application designed to streamline the process of filing and managing First Information Reports (FIRs) across multiple police stations. Traditionally, FIRs are filed manually, which can lead to inefficiencies and delays. This system digitizes the FIR process, allowing reports to be filed, viewed, and managed online, making it more accessible and efficient.

### Key Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system to ensure only authorized users can access the dashboard.
- **FIR Filing:** Users can file new FIRs with details such as title, description, and location.
- **FIR Management:** View all FIRs with options to delete resolved cases. FIRs are time-stamped for better tracking.
- **Data Security:** Basic encryption mechanisms are in place to protect sensitive data.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8 or higher**: Ensure that Python is installed on your machine.
